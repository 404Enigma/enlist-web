        <h2>Beta version of Enlist, when it was still in development.</h2>
        <p>
            We released Enlist in its <strong>beta</strong> to test the basic functionality and to look for any flaws in the product. Our classmates went through it for some amount of time. Some bugs were reported, which were resolved to the best of our efforts before the <strong>official release (v1.0)</strong> of Enlist. <br><br> We really appreciate all our friends who helped in making our platform more flawless. ✨
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>beta</strong> version included the functionality of shared tasks or keep it as a personal task. If any user wants to keep the task to himself then (s)he can add using the PERSONAL feature. So, that task won't appear in other people's lists.
            If any user wants to share the task to the whole team/class, then (s)he can add using the SHARED feature. Hence, it will automatically sync to everyone's list.
            Edit, done and delete operations on a particular task are individual for everyone and the changes made by that user won't occur in other people's list.

            During this pandemic we faced a problem to how sync and figure out what all assignments are given by professors. We always used to miss the deadlines.

            Then we found that others are facing the same problem as well. So, we came up with an idea of making a to-do list which will serve as a system to get on track of that all assignments that are pending.
